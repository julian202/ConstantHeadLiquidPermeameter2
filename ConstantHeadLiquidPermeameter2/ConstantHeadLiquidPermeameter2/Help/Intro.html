<h3>The PMI Constant Head Liquid Permeameter  </h3>
<p>  The PMI Constant Head Liquid Permeameter is designed according to ISO 11058:1999(E). The water level is held constant as water flows from the tank above the machine into the U-shaped tube. The water flows through the sample and into a container situated to the left of the U-shaped tube which lies on top of a scale that measures weight in grams. The computer records the weight of the collected water as a function of time. The permeability of the sample will be proportional to the total weight of water collected at the end of the test. </p>
<p>  To set up a sample unscrew the aluminum sample holder counter-clockwise by hand. Make sure the U-shaped tube is filled with water underneath the sample right up to the sample before placing it, this will reduce the amount of air trapped inside below the sample. Before the beginning of a test, the valves controlling the amount of water that flows in have to be manually adjusted until the water level in the U-shaped tube is constant (constant water head). Of the four valves, the top valve should be opened first as it offers the most control.   
</p>
<p>  The rubber pump connected to the main tube serves two purposes. By squeezing it with force with one hand (and covering the end of the tube so that no air leaks) we can pump air into the tube and thus remove air bubbles that are trapped on top of the sample. It is very important to perform this bubble removal process several times before each test. The second purpose of this tube is to act as a vent. It is therefore very important that it remains unobstructed whenever we are not performing the bubble removing process.
</p>
<p> The height of the water head (labeled H in the figure) should be written down before each test. If performing a single test, an H of 50mm should be selected. Otherwise choose a range from 20mm to 70mm in multiple test and calculate an interpolation at 50mm. A program is included to aid you with this interpolation (see the Report section).
</p>
<p> At the beginning of each test the computer zero's the scale reading. However, before starting each test make sure that the tank with the collected water is not full. Also make sure that the tank at the top of the machine is full of water. The longer the water rests before starting a test the better because the water will de-air on it's own. During the test you must constantly check that the water level remains constant and adjust the water valves in order to accomplish this.
</p>
<p> When changing a sample make sure you drain the water above the sample by opening the valve that is located at the bottom of the U-shaped tube.
</p>
<p>  The program has a timed mode and a manual mode, the only difference being that the timed mode stops automatically at the specified time. In the Report section you can open previously saved data files (data files are created automatically during a test). You can open multiple data files from different test and overlay their graphs in order to compare experiments.
</p>
<p>  The settings panel can be accessed via the settings button found in the manual mode window. In the settings panel we can adjust the number of times that an autotest will run (if we select more than one, the autotest will run more than one test, maximum of ten, until the the average of the tests is within a value that can be also set in the settings panel). The data file will show the average of these tests.
</p> 
<p>   While testing the machine with our samples we determined that each test should run between 1 minute and 3 minutes, with less permeable samples taking longer. Again, to ensure reproducibility, make sure that the micro-air bubbles that are trapped at the sample during each test are removed before starting a new test. You can remove them with the rubber pump while blocking the vent tube.
